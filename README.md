I am ddow229. I have a MS in Applied Data Analytics from the Aerican Publc Uniersity. My Master's project was a look at the theory that responsible businesses are more profitable than other companies. I have that study saved here on GitHub.
I work as a business analyst for a major corporation. Currently my work is based in item forecasting. 
I am studying Practical Statisitcs for Data Scientists. It is an area that I feel I am lacking. As I work through some independent work I will be adding it to my hub.
